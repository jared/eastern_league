    <p>Just wanted to remind everyone that early registration for the 19th annual Old Dominion Sport Kite Championships (ODSKC) ends on June 1, so register now and save yourself 10 bucks!  We're going to have a great time at ODSKC.  I'm hoping to do a workshop on Friday evening on the new Program Precision format.  I'm hoping to have an open discussion that looks at Program Precision from both the judge's and competitor's perspective.  Not sure where it'll be yet, but I'll get more details out to everyone as the picture becomes clearer.</p>
