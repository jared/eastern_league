     This is a really cool kite.  It was built as part of a show being put on for a corporate event in Las Vegas, this kite was flown for just one performance in the Forum Ballroom at Caesar's Palace.  The Echo is one of my all-time favorite kites, equally fun as either an indoor kite or in low or no wind conditions outdoors.  I've flown my other Echo kites on the boardwalk in Wildwood, NJ as well as Ocean City, MD, and even in the plaza at the Katara Cultural Village in Doha, Qatar, on 20 foot lines to play in close to crowds.  I've also flown an Echo in and around the Baltimore Convention Center while I was attending a software development conference.
