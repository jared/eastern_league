    <p>Will Sturdyâ€™s rise as a Masters class dual-line flier and kitebuilder has
    been nothing less than meteoric. Years of development led to the Saber. That
    kite won the AKAGN 2008 sport kite kitebuilding competition, and in 2010 he
    was crowned Grand National Champion at the AKA convention. This gives you
    some indication of the meticulous worksmanship that Will puts into his
    kites.&nbsp; Will also flew the Saber to victory in the AKAGN Experienced
    Individual Dual-line Ballet competition. He is now regularly finishing near
    the top of the heap in Masters class dual-line competitions along the
    Eastern seaboard, and his entries in Virtual Freestyle events are garnering
    him international acclaim both as a flier and a builder.<br /><br />
    And just to drive the point home, my first Master's Ballet win of the 2013 season was flown on a Saber III, so you don't have to be Will Sturdy to succeed on this kite!
